<p class="mama">
    I have always loved acting since I was a little girl. I used to perform in school plays, mimic my favorite stars, and dream of being on the big screen. I have worked hard to pursue my passion, and now I am finally getting some recognition for my talent. I have done some roles in different genres, languages, and platforms, but I am not satisfied yet. I want to do more. I want to challenge myself and explore new dimensions of my craft.

    My dream is to do some iconic and challenging characters that will make Indian cinema known to the world. I want to be part of films that have a global appeal, that showcase the diversity and richness of our culture, and that tell stories that touch people’s hearts. I want to work with the best directors, writers, and co-stars in the industry, and learn from them. I want to collaborate with artists from other countries, and exchange ideas and experiences.
    
    I also want to do films that have a positive impact on society. I want to use my voice and influence to raise awareness about important issues, such as gender equality, education, environment, and human rights. I want to inspire people to be more compassionate, empathetic, and responsible. I want to be a role model for the younger generation, especially girls who aspire to follow their dreams.
    
    I know it is not easy to achieve all this, but I am ready to face any obstacle that comes my way. I believe in myself, and I have the support of my family, friends, and fans. I am grateful for every opportunity that comes my way, and I always give my best in every project. I am passionate about acting, and I will never stop learning and growing as an artist. This is my dream, and I will make it come true.
